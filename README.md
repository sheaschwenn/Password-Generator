## Description 

[Visit my Random Password Generator](https://sheaschwenn.github.io/Password-Generator/)

This password generator allows users to input how long they would like their password to be (between 8 and 128 characters) and select from the four different character types: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters.  It then takes the user input and creates a randomized password that fits the users chosen criteria. This was done using JavaScript and various alerts, confirms and prompts.

## JavaScript Example

Turning the lowercase array into an all uppercase array by using the map() method and then the .toUpperCase method
```js
 var uppercase = lowercase.map(lowercase =>lowercase.toUpperCase())  
```

Creating a function that will randomly pick an item out of any array that it is given. This code is really reausable so I was able to call this same function for all of my character type arrays.  

```js
 function randomCharacter(array){
    character = array[Math.floor(Math.random()*array.length)];
    return character;
 }
```

## Usage 

This web application can be used to generate a randomized password between 8 and 128 characters in length.

## Learning Points 
Creating this application was a great opportunity to familiarize myself with functions in, if statements and for loops within JavaScrips
Other Learning points were: 
* How global and local variables actually work and the importance of where variables are defined 
* Alerts, Confirms and Prompts
* How useful boolean values can be in acting simiar to (light) switches
* Methods that can be applied to arrays 


I also learned that the way I did my for loops in this project is not the norm, going forward I will use the syntax 
```md 
for(var i = 0; i<array.length; i++) ;
```
intead of 
```md 
for(var i = array.length; i>0; i--);   
```

## Credits

To randomly shuffle the final password I used a tutorial on shuffling an array.  I used the basis of this tutorial but instead of using a while loop I used a for loop since those were more familiar to me and made scense in the constext of shuffling my password array. I found out that this is called the Fisher-Yates shuffle.
